# Vadere

Vadere is an open source framework for the simulation of microscopic pedestrian and crowd dynamics. Vadere provides generic model classes and visualisation and data analysis tools for two-dimensional systems. A series of pedestrian locomotion models are already implemented in the framework that are also the basis for scientific publications. Namely the optimal steps model, the gradient navigation model, and the social force model are available for simulation studies. In addition to pedestrians, other systems including cars and granular flow can be introduced into the framework.

This software runs on Windows, OS X and Linux.

Vadere has been developed by [Prof. Dr. Gerta KÃ¶ster's](http://www.cs.hm.edu/die_fakultaet/ansprechpartner/professoren/koester/index.de.html)
research group at the [Munich University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hm.edu/) at the
[department for Computer Science and Mathematics](http://cs.hm.edu/).
However, we welcome contributions from external sources. 

The Vadere framework includes a mesh generator for unstructured high-quality 2D meshes called **EikMesh** which is described [here](https://gitlab.lrz.de/vadere/vadere/wikis/eikmesh/Overview).

If you are using Vadere for your publication, please cite: http://dx.doi.org/10.17815/CD.2019.21. 

### Vadere Units 

All measurements in Vadere are in SI units. That means, meters for the positions in the GUI and Topography, and meter/second for speeds.

## Installation

### Dependencies

* Java 11 (OpenJDK recommended -> see [here](http://www.vadere.org/getting-started/) for more information) (not tested for > 11)
* OpenCL (optional but recommended -> see the [install instructions](https://gitlab.lrz.de/vadere/vadere/tree/master/Documentation/installation/OpenCL-Installation.md) for details)

### Pre-Built Releases

Latest build of master:
* [Windows](http://www.vadere.org/builds/master/vadere.master.windows.zip)
* [Linux](http://www.vadere.org/builds/master/vadere.master.linux.zip)

Stable releases and selected branch-builds:
* [https://www.vadere.org/download/](https://www.vadere.org/download/)

The ZIP file contains:
* **README.md** - this README file. 
* **vadere-gui.jar** - provides the GUI version of Vadere.
* **vadere-console.jar** - provides the command line version of Vadere and allows easy integration into other applications.
* **Scenarios** - contains test scenarios for pedestrian locomotion models. Note: The tests are also useful for a "getting started" (see below "Run Built-In Examples" for details).

### Getting Started

Either run the Vadere simulator by

- Double-clicking `vadere-gui.jar` (after installing [Java](http://www.vadere.org/getting-started/))
- Entering `path/to/openjdk/java -jar vadere-gui.jar`

### Scenario Files

You can find some example scenarios under [Scenarios/Demos](./Scenarios/Demos)

For more info see [Scenario File Specification](./Documentation/scenario/scenario-file-specification.md)

### Run Built-In Examples

With the following steps, you can run a simulation with one of the built-in examples from [Scenarios](Scenarios):

- Start Vadere 
- Click *Project* > *Open* 
- Choose `vadere.project` of one of the test projects, e.g. [TestOSM](https://gitlab.lrz.de/vadere/vadere/tree/master/Scenarios/ModelTests/TestOSM) and click *open*
- Select the scenario on the left and press *run selected scenario*

## Build from Source

### Dependencies

* Java 11 or above (OpenJDK recommended)
* Maven 3.0
* Git
* OpenCL (optional but recommended)

**Note:** Please, ensure that the Git executable can be found in the `PATH` variable of your operating system.

### Build Instructions

1. git clone https://gitlab.lrz.de/vadere/vadere.git
2. cd vadere
3. mvn clean
4. mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true package
